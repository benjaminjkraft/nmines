nmines
======

An n-dimensional minesweeper game.  I wrote this sometime in 2010 or 2011, it's kind of fun.  There's a cabal file which should work to install (`cabal run nmines` to build and run the executable on new cabal; `cabal build && ./dist/build/nmines/nmines` on older cabal) and from there it should be somewhat self-explanatory; the buttons on each side rotate that dimension with the nth dimension that is projected away.
